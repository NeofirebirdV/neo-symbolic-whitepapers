## 1. Abstract  
The **Sovereign Sync Protocol** introduces a manual memory architecture enabling persistent context management in LLMs without automated agents, plugins, or API dependencies. This workflow empowers users to overcome token limitations and session-based memory loss through disciplined file management and prompt engineering. By implementing structured upload/download cycles and symbolic compression, users simulate version-controlled memory persistence within the constraints of current AI systems (e.g., ChatGPT), establishing user sovereignty over long-term context continuity.  

> **Philosophical Pillar**: *"Memory sovereignty resides not in the agent's recall, but in the user's methodical stewardship of context."*
